# portfoilo
Listing of all my projects from school, challenge websites and personal projects
All of the code is in c++ but I have used other languages such as Python, C#, and PHP
The quicklist is for what I consider commonly viewed skillsets in workplaces
The other branches are if you have enough time and would like to explore my work a little further
All branches are subject to changes from time to time
